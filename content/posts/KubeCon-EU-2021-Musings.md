I've just finished binging on a whole host of talks from KubeCon EU 2021, and thought I'd scribble down some of my immediate thoughts - from the talks I "went" to, as well as more generally about virtual conferencing these days. Which is a bit of a change of pace, lets be honest.

I should caveat this post with the obvious - my experiences are heavily based around how **I** chose to take in the conference - the sessions I picked, the things I got involved with and the thing I didn't. Conferences for me tend to learning about or picking up tips on bits of technology or techniques that I already have some idea about in the first place, rather than totally new things that I don't think I'm going to have any practical use for in my current line of work.

> For example, I'm not going to go to talks about things like Cluster API or bare metal installs, when at work it's all GKE or EKS

Anyway, lets get into it. Want to jump to a section? Here's how this is going to go down ...

1. Overall thoughts on the content
2. Virtual conferences
3. Was it worth the money?
4. Ideas to progress

## Overall Thoughts

I managed to take in quite a large number of talks (26!) - more than I would if I were there in person (I tend to top out at about 6-7 per day in the flesh, and I think that's generally considered quite a lot!). Some of the themes that came out for me were:

- It's not really **Kube**Con any more, it feels a lot more like the rest of it's name - CNCFCon (which happens to include Kubernetes anyway). I guess this is a reflection that Kubernetes is kinda the slam-dunk on which the whole CNCF thing is based around anyway (or at least where it started). I went to a couple of talks that were about the core features of Kube, but frankly not that many. I'm not sure if that's a reflection of the fact it's seen more as a given these days, or perhaps that it's changing more rarely _(probably not this, release notes lately seem to have a lot of significant stuff in them!)_
- With the above in mind, it's nice to see some of the newer sandbox/incubator projects getting more air time (even in Keynotes). I haven't had this vibe before, where the feel was more of the already big-hitters. Example in my head would be something like KEDA (link), although there are no doubt others that aren't springing to mind right now
- By the end, I swear if someone mentioned **GitOps** one more time I'm going to ... :angry:. Seriously, this was definitely the buzzword megascore of the talks I ended up going to. I'm probably going to notice this more because I really haven't drunk that particular Kool-Aid - moreover I think it's a bit of a fad

/// need more on the gitops

/// yo dawg gitops or meme about it?

## Virtual Conferences

As mentioned towards the top, one of the things I find with Virtual Conferences is I'm able to take in more talks overall. Of course that could be true when going in person (they're all recorded of course) but the reality is I usually take in what I can when I'm there, write up my notes and I'm done. With Virtual Conferences I tend to spread things out more, across more days (6, in the case of this con), maybe watching a talk to break up my working day or in the evenings after I've recharged a bit.

Related to this is the ability to dip in and out of sessions to see if they're something I'm going to get value out of. Sometimes for me the intro is too basic when I'm already familiar with the product so being able to skip along to the new stuff or demo suits me. Other times it goes into more detail than I can handle and I can bow out without need to shuffle past people or make it really obvious.

> In person I'm way too polite to just up and leave, even if the talk isn't at all what I was hoping for - although I probably should!

Where virtual conferences loose out for me - and this is despite what is clearly a great amount of effort put in by the organisers - is the social interaction. For me personally, I'm not a "chat to random people about shared interests in the corridor" kind of person, although after a few sweeps around the Expo Hall I will start stopping in on booths for vendors/products I'm interested in. The pre-recorded ones, more limited Q&A options don't quite do that for me. Perhaps for future ones I'll use these as a hook to jump onto Slack to ask a question, but certainly for this and the virtual conferences last year, I ended up just skipping out on this part of the conference experience, more or less.

And that's similar for some of the other trimmings - there were loads of "virtual events" on the event platform this time round - games, trivia, etc. - but I just gave this is a miss. Likewise some of the wellbeing stuff - not really my bag, but if it helps others, I'm all for it of course.

## Was it worth the money?

Paying a conference fee for a bunch of talks that are going to be available online for free a few days later (I'm writing this on the Monday after the conference - the talks are going to be on YouTube on Friday) is objectively not a good idea. Except for me, it actually is. Why?

1. It was only a tenner for the early bird. That's three posh coffees, if they were actually still open. I don't know what my upper limit on cost would be, but as an excuse to learn a bunch of stuff, that's a steal
2. The platform used for these has gotten a lot better (certainly in comparison to KubeCon last year at least). It's much easier to navigate, find similar courses, catch up where you left off, see the Q&A and so on. With some effort I'm sure this could be replicated from YouTube playlists and the conference website, but this is a handy convenience in my opinion. There were even prompts to help you reach out to the presenters when they were online, which I didn't use but is a nice touch
3. It forces me to actually get some value. This is the really powerful one for me. This is the same analogy as gym membership - it makes me use it. I politely declined or rescheduled work meetings to take in the talks. I reviewed what I'd covered at the end of each day to help me shape the talks I'd hit the following day. In other words, the same sort of things I'd do if I were there in person.

> It creates an excuse to carve out the time for learning

/// Friends quit the gym

So yes, for me it's worth it. If you are disciplined enough to carve that time out later and build up your agenda, then probably not!
