My personal blog site.

## To Do

- [ ] Simplify and clean up theme - too busy
- [ ] Mirror the repo to github
- [ ] Broken link finder
- [ ] Journey tests
- [ ] Solution that involves no Google Analytics
- [ ] Write blog post about how the site works

On a post:
- drop caps from tagline
- restyle buttons at bottom
- push footer to bottom
- darken menu bar
- move share options to menu bar
- github link

On home page:
- logo
- large hero banner - maybe from that slide template?
- menu bar only on scroll
- drop left menu
- restyle posts list to allow a lot more space

Search:
- needs way more padding

Tags:
- to tag cloud

Dark mode:
- keeps redrawing on click

Contact:
- successful send should pop

About:
- remove recent posts but keep photo
- check content still relevant

- [ ] JS - modernizr.custom.71422.js
- [ ] JS - perfect-scrollbar.jquery.min.js + perfect-scrollbar.min.js
- [ ] Harden nginx build
- [ ] Move to Github so there's some proper stuff there
- [ ] Not sure about placement of social links on blog post - make a bit more subtle?
- [ ] Print the tags somewhere on posts
- [ ] How about some tests?
- [ ] Reclick on share button hides it
- [ ] Hover effects equivalent for thumbs?
- [ ] Auto-minify css/js
- [ ] Accessibility testing
- [ ] Contacts form maybe does not need the labels at all with the placeholders?
- [ ] Recent posts to use thumbnail rather than description (see Future Imperfect)
- [ ] Tranquil Peak - hide sidebar when reading a post is nice
- [ ] Captcha on the Contacts form
- [ ] Printable version - colours especially need inverting
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Sticky footer - https://codepen.io/BretCameron/pen/oVNYKR
- [ ] Tags cloud
- [ ] Portfolio page (inc where host?)
- [ ] Archives page for whole taxonomy (Tranquil Peak)

### Fancier Formatting

- [ ] Keys to navigate left and right
- [ ] Gradient backgrounds: https://gradienthunt.com/gradient/1955
- [ ] Tranquil Peak - animation load of the about page
- [ ] Slight zoom-in effect on panels / image banners
- [ ] meghna has some cool animations - especially social buttons at bottom
- [ ] Pinch animations from https://www.demisto.com/community/
